    <h3>I was born in Bangalore, India on October 12, 2007. I was my parents only kid at the time. 
        My sister was born some years later. My dad and mom lived together with me for one year, and then my dad left to the USA.
        My mom and I were living by ourselves in India for about 9 months, and then we moved to the USA.
        We moved to Kentucky, and I started my school there. Then, when I was about to start kindergarten, we moved to Connecticut.
        I started elementary school there, and my kindergarten year, my little sister was born.</h3>
